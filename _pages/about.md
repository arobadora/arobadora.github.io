Hello there! I'm Alberto, an Assistant Professor for Research at the University of Southern California (USC) in the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bisc/), section [Marine and Environmental Biology](https://dornsife.usc.edu/meb/).

My work and research
------
My research combines insights from marine geobiology with those of thermochemistry in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of ENERGY FLOW VIA MICROORGANISMS IN THE OCEAN. I consider energy flow to be the FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIZATIONAL PROPERTY THAT TIES THE PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS. My specific aim is to develop a holistic approach that can underpin a realistic MONITORING PROGRAM to obtain a comprehensive energy budget for marine ecosystems. I believe that this approach is uniquely suited to improve our understanding of the structure and function of the ocean, including the regulation of biogeochemical cycles and the balance of the global marine biomass in a context of environmental change.

My background and history
------
I received my Ph.D. from the [Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/en/Home.html) in 2009. I spent the follwoing years as a research associate in various teams within the [NASA Astrobiology Instiute at the at the University of Hawaii (UHNAI)](https://uhnai.ifa.hawaii.edu) and the [Life Underground](https://dornsife.usc.edu/life-underground) NASA Astrobiology Institute at the University of Southern California (USC) as well as the [Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations](https://www.darkenergybiosphere.org) and . In 2018, I joined the Department of Biological Sciences –section Marine and Environmental Biology– at USC as an Assistant Professor for Research. In 2021, I am joining the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) as a Fellow developing research under the focus Earth.

My intellectual communities
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
