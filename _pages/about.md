My research combines insights from marine geobiology with those of thermochemistry in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of ENERGY FLOW VIA MICROORGANISMS IN THE OCEAN. I consider energy flow to be the FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIZATIONAL PROPERTY THAT TIES THE PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL COMPONENTS OF ECOSYSTEMS. My specific aim is to develop a holistic approach that can underpin a realistic MONITORING PROGRAM to obtain a comprehensive energy budget for marine ecosystems. I believe that this approach is uniquely suited to improve our understanding of the structure and function of the ocean, including the regulation of biogeochemical cycles and the balance of the global marine biomass in a context of environmental change.

I received my Ph.D. from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in 2009. I spent the follwoing years as a research associate in various teams within the NASA Astrobiology Institute as well as the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations at the at the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California (USC). In 2018, I joined the Department of Biological Sciences at USC as an Assistant Research Professor. In 2021, I am joining the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK) as a Fellow developing research under the focus Earth.

Energy as a microbial physiological variable
------
To provide a background for examining the energy flow principle in marine ecosystems, we shall also consider particular model systems which are designed to illustrate some of the limitations of natural systems and indicate the special areas of inquiry necessary to overcome these limitations.

For example, the study of bacterial populations in long-term stationary-phase (LTSP) laboratory cultures can provide insights into physiological and genetic adaptations to varying energy conditions and population dynamics in natural environments. While overall population density remains stable in multi-week and multi-year LTSP cultures, these communities are very dynamic and are characterized by the rapid emergence and succession of distinct mutants expressing the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, which can reflect an increased capacity to withstand energy fluctuations and general environmental stress. The ability of GASP mutants to withstand energy limitation for months to years due to the accumulation of novel mutations raises the question of whether it is possible to adapt to natural systems with energy limitations, specifically as a selective pressure. Using nanocalorimetry, I have also identified previously unknown growth dynamics related to the temporal expression of an advantageous phenotype that allow mutants to capitalize on the decrease of energy over prolonged periods of time by remaining in an active, but limited, metabolic state. Similar strategies to those characterized in my laboratory strains might be relevant to understand mechanisms of survival in environmental bacteria over extended periods of low energy stress

GASP phenotype becomes apparent on heat flow profiles (shaded red lines) of anaerobic stationary-phase E. coli cultures (grey circles and black line). Metabolic heat effects show the rise of 3 consecutive GASP mutant populations in LTSP monoculture and were analyzed to estimate their specific growth. Cell viability was measured in triplicate (solid grey circles and solid line). The detection limit was 10 CFU/ml, and the titering error is within 3-fold. Modified from Robador et al. 2019, Appl. Environ. Microbiol.

Energetic bookkeeping in ocean ecosystems
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

Development of new instrumentation for use in biogeochemical monitoring
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
